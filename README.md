# SpotifyProject

## Summary
Congratulations! After a grueling three weeks of training, you’re finally starting your summer internship at Spotify. They’ve seen what you're capable of and really want you to hit the ground running, so they’ve assigned you and the other interns to their social media extension of Spotify, spoti.love. Your managers will be keeping a close eye on you and will be available for questions, but your team is responsible for the final deliverable. The Spotify board is also interested in the viability of this application going forward, so you will be presenting your application to your managers and the Spotify board on Friday. Needless to say, impressing the board in the first week of your internship would set the tone for a great summer. Let’s see what you can do!

## Details
Using React, Express, and Firebase, create a web application using the Spotify API. The purpose of the app is to keep users engaged with Spotify by allowing them to view their top artists and songs, create a profile that other users can view, post in message boards, and message other users. Spotify wants to be the place where people go to listen to AND talk about music. Your app will accomplish this with a React frontend, Express backend, and Firebase database. This means that all API or database interactions initiated by the user should send a request from the frontend (React) to the backend (Express), where the interaction with the Spotify API or Firebase occurs.
